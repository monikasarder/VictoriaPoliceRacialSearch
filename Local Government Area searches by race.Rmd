# Data overview 

This contains the summary of over 13,000 warrantless searches carried out by regular uniform police across Victoria under the drugs power whilst on foot patrol in public places, in the years 2018, 2019, 2022 and 2023, available from  [**The Racial Profiling Data Monitoring Project**](https://khaki-pepper-b3rf.squarespace.com/).

Note that 2020 and 2021 data is not included in this data due to the extraordinary circumstances of the COVID 19 pandemic.


Under section 82 of the [*Drugs Poisons and Controlled Substances Act 1981*](http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/dpacsa1981422/s82.html) a police officer who believes there are reasonable ground for suspecting that a person is in possession of an illegal drug in a public place, may stop and search a person.

Drug searches the most common warrantless search undertaken by police in Victoria.

## Ethnic appearance categories  

Victoria Police records the ethnic appearance of the people that they search without warrant based on existing categories. These categories are not based on ancestry information, but on *perceived ethnicity* as considered by the officer. 

***Missing data***

A total of 2,860 search records, or 21% of all records, did not have any ethnic appearance data entered, despite this field being mandatory for 'stop and searches' since 2019. 


## Melbourne drug searches - which areas and groups are subject to racial profiling

The find rates for persons of different ethnic appearances for Local Government Areas appears below. Find rates for ethnic appearances in areas where less than twenty searches were recorded were excluded from the analysis.

# Appendix - ethnic appearance mapping  

Ethnic appearance categories for different years were transformed to enable comparison across the four years. A table of transformations undertaken, along with the number of searches in each category, appears below,


```{r Map 1, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message = FALSE}

ethnic.mapping1 <-dat %>%
  filter(Year %in% c(2022, 2023))%>%
  count(Ethnic.Appearance.original, Ethnic.appearance.abridged)

ethnic.mapping1 %>%
  kable()
```

```{r Map 2, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message = FALSE}

ethnic.mapping2 <- dat %>%
  filter(Year %in% c(2018, 2019))%>%
  count(Ethnic.Appearance.original, Ethnic.appearance.abridged) 


ethnic.mapping2 %>%
  kable()
```
